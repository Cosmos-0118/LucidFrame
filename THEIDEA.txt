# HyperRestore: AI Image & Video Upscaler

Turn blurry, low-res memories into sharp, modern-quality photos and videos using production-grade open-source super-resolution models.

HyperRestore focuses on instant, visual “wow”: drop in an old photo or compressed video and get a side‑by‑side, upscaled result within seconds.

---

## Problem

- Old family photos and videos look tiny, blurry, and heavily compressed on modern 1080p/4K screens.  
- Existing tools are either:
  - Too technical (CLI scripts, scattered repos, manual model setup), or  
  - Paywalled / cloud-only with privacy concerns.  

There is no simple, local-first, cross‑platform app that non-technical users can trust for one-click enhancement of their media.

## One-Line Solution

A local, privacy-first AI app that upscales and restores photos and videos with one click, using the same class of tech as premium tools, but fully open-source.

---

## Core Features

### Smart Image Upscaling

- 2x and 4x upscaling using Real-ESRGAN General-x4v3 / x4plus for general photos and screenshots.  
- Automatic removal of JPEG artifacts, noise, and compression blocks.  
- Modes:
  - Photo mode (Real-ESRGAN General)  
  - Anime/UI mode (anime/cartoon-optimized model)

### Face-Aware Restoration

- Optional face enhancement using a dedicated face restoration model (e.g., GFPGAN).  
- Pipeline:
  - Detect faces  
  - Restore facial details  
  - Merge restored faces back into the upscaled image  

This gives a “premium tool”-style look with an open, local pipeline.

### Video Upscaling Pipeline

- Extract frames from video, upscale with Real-ESRGAN, then reconstruct.  
- Optional frame interpolation (e.g., via RIFE) for smoother motion (such as 24 → 48 fps).  
- Targets:
  - Old phone recordings  
  - Downloaded low-res clips  
  - Screen recordings and gameplay footage  

### “Old Memories” Guided Mode

A guided workflow for non-technical users:

- Import a folder or drive containing old media.  
- Automatic clustering:
  - Group by people (face clustering), date, or simple event-like sessions.  
- Batch apply:
  - Upscale photos  
  - Restore faces when present  
  - Optionally upscale and smooth short videos  

Result: a Before vs After gallery that clearly showcases restored memories.

## Killer Demo Scenario

For a hackathon demo:

1. Show a 3–5 second low-res, heavily compressed video (e.g., 240p/360p).  
2. Click “Enhance Video”:
   - Upscale to 1080p.  
   - Optionally double the frame rate using frame interpolation.  
3. Instantly play side‑by‑side before/after:
   - Left: original small, noisy video.  
   - Right: sharp, larger, smoother version.  

Then:

- Show a single old photo with faces.  
- Click “Photo + Face Restore”.  
- Use a slider to scrub between before/after over the face region.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack

- Backend: Python  
  - FastAPI for HTTP APIs  
  - Integrations:
    - Real-ESRGAN for image/video super-resolution  
    - GFPGAN (or similar) for face restoration  
    - RIFE (or similar) for video frame interpolation  
- Frontend:  
  - Tauri or Electron for desktop (Windows/Linux/macOS)  
  - Simple, reactive UI (e.g., React/Svelte) with drag‑and‑drop and instant preview  

### High-Level Pipelines

**Image pipeline**

1. Receive image and preset from UI.  
2. Optional: denoise/deblock step.  
3. Apply Real-ESRGAN for 2x or 4x upscale.  
4. If enabled, run face restoration and merge enhanced faces.  
5. Return final image and a preview to the UI.

**Video pipeline**

1. Receive video and preset from UI.  
2. Extract frames and audio (FFmpeg or similar).  
3. Apply Real-ESRGAN to each frame.  
4. Optionally apply frame interpolation for smoother motion.  
5. Reassemble frames and audio into final video file.  
6. Return output with progress updates and a short preview clip.

## MVP Scope for a Weekend Hackathon

### Must-Have

- Local install with bundled models:
  - One general Real-ESRGAN model.  
  - One face restoration model.  
- Image pipeline:
  - 2x and 4x upscaling.  
  - Toggle for face restoration.  
- Basic video pipeline:
  - 2x upscaling using the same Real-ESRGAN model.  
  - Simple video reconstruction using FFmpeg.

### Nice-to-Have

- Frame interpolation for 2x frame rate on videos.  
- Anime mode toggle using an anime/cartoon-optimized model.  
- Gallery view with:
  - Before/after slider for images.  
  - Side-by-side player for videos.

## Why Judges Will Like It

- Visually impressive before/after demos in under 30 seconds.  
- Uses serious, real-world models but focuses on UX and integration rather than re-inventing the wheel.  
- Local-first and privacy-friendly: no media leaves the user’s machine.  
- Extensible: easy to swap models and add new presets for screenshots, CCTV footage, or anime.
